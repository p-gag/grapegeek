**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

Research cold-climate grape varieties in the specified region by systematically analyzing wineries and their product offerings.
Use ONLY information found through web search - never invent wineries or varieties.
Follow this exact research methodology:

**RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:**

## Phase 1: Identify Regional Wineries
- Search for wineries, vineyards, and wine producers in the specified region
- Use trade association websites, wine directories, and regional wine guides
- Focus on producers who grow grapes (not just buy fruit)
- Create a comprehensive list of wine producers with their websites

## Phase 2: Extract Product Information
For each winery identified:
- Visit their website and online shop
- Examine their wine portfolio and product descriptions
- Look for varietal wines, blends, and wine descriptions that mention grape varieties
- Pay special attention to hybrid varieties and cold-climate grapes

## Phase 3: Extract Grape Varieties
From each wine product:
- Identify ALL grape varieties mentioned (both hybrid and vinifera)
- Note the wine style (e.g., "Dry Red", "Sparkling", "Orange Wine")
- Record the winemaker/producer name
- Save the product link or page reference

## Phase 4: Organize Results
Create a ranked list format:

**REGION: [Region Name]**

**GRAPE VARIETIES (Most Popular to Least):**

1. **[Variety Name]** (X products found)
   - Wine Style - Producer Name: [link or description]
   - Wine Style - Producer Name: [link or description]

2. **[Next Variety]** (Y products found)
   - Wine Style - Producer Name: [link or description]

**RESEARCH SOURCES:**
- List all wineries and websites searched
- Include trade association and directory sources used

**FOCUS ON:**
- Cold-climate hybrid varieties (Marquette, Frontenac, La Crescent, etc.)
- Regional specialties and unique varieties
- Small-batch and experimental wines
- Natural/orange wines often use interesting varieties

**QUALITY CONTROL:**
- Verify variety names are spelled correctly
- Only include varieties explicitly mentioned by producers
- Do not assume or infer variety information
- If information is unclear, note as "variety not specified"

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Organize as a comprehensive research report with clear variety rankings and extensive source links.
