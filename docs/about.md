# Grape Geek

Welcome to **Grape Geek**! 🍇

## About This Project

**Grape Geek** is my project dedicated to shining a light on hybrid grape varieties grown in the chilly climates of the northeast US and eastern Canada. These grapes often fly under the radar compared to their well-known vinifera cousins. My goal is to use AI tools and web searches to curate a treasure trove of **cited, field-tested, and winemaker-backed insights** into these unique varieties.

### How I Use AI

In my day job, I use AI to help employees navigate large internal knowledge bases that are unknown to AI models. AI models don't perform well at retaining information about hybrid grapes because the topic is too niche. When you ask AI about an obscure variety, it will certainly hallucinate.

This site heavily uses AI for all the research and gluing together of content, but I try not to rely on the imprecise AI model "memory." Instead, I use these powerful tools to venture into the wild corners of the internet to find interesting facts or testimonies. I work hard to keep citations and references so that readers—including myself—can go and discover all these resources.

### My Personal Perspective and Biases

Beyond the obvious vinifera bias, I want to be transparent about my own leanings:

**Organic Viticulture Focus:** I have a strong preference for organic viticulture. This isn't a judgment on non-organic practices—I have huge respect for everyone growing grapes for a living with all the risks involved, whatever their approach. My organic focus is grounded in a very long-term, multi-generational goal of adapting wine grapes to various diseases. I have the luxury of not doing this for money, which allows me to take this longer view.

**Quebec Bias (and Maritime Quebec Specifically):** I have a clear Quebec bias, and even more specifically toward maritime Quebec (yes, very niche), because it's where I live. That said, I'm actively trying to include other regions in northern America because many did and still are making massive contributions. The grapes created by the great northern US hybridizers were and still are key to Quebec's success.

### What Grape Geek is About

* **Focus on Hybrids:** I'm all about hybrid grapes that thrive in colder regions. Unlike vinifera grapes (which have loads of existing info), hybrids are less documented and often full of surprises.
* **Casual Yet Transparent:** I blend careful sourcing and citations with a friendly, approachable tone. The idea is to make learning about these grapes enjoyable for everyone, from wine geeks to curious gardeners, while promoting the resources where I found the information.
* **Facts and Stories, No Forced Conclusions:** Some parts will be more fact-based (technical growing information, climate data), while others will focus on stories from growers and winemakers sharing their real experiences. Because the world of hybrid grapes is still evolving, I emphasize **showcasing different experiences and testimonials** rather than claiming definitive truths.

### Why Only Hybrids in the Northeast?

I'm focusing on the northeastern US and eastern Canada because these regions are true testing grounds for cold-hardy hybrids. This is where you'll find unique varieties that aren't household names—yet! And it's precisely because they're less documented that I think they deserve a spotlight.

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So I'll treat these "entities"—like researchers, growers, winemakers, breeders, magazines—as a kind of special highlight. That way, each page isn't just a dry list of facts; it's sprinkled with personal, relatable quotes and sources from these individuals and groups.
