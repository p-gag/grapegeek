# Welcome to Grape Geek! 🍇

**Grape Geek** is a project dedicated to shining a light on hybrid grape varieties grown in the chilly climates of the northeast US and eastern Canada. These grapes often fly under the radar compared to their well-known vinifera cousins.

The data collection in this site starts by identifying winegrowers, then automation was built to research the wines produced and extract varieties used. Here are some stats:

📍 9 US states and 4 Canadian provinces  
🍇 1,491 winegrowers researched  
🍾 16,372 wines catalogued  
🌿 249 grape varieties  
🌐 1,428 websites discovered  
📱 2,238 social accounts identified
