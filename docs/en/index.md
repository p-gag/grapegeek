# Welcome to Grape Geek! 🍇

!!! warning "🚧 Under Construction 🚧"
    This site is under active development. New content about hybrid grape varieties will be added regularly. La version française a besoin de plus d'amour. **Some content still lack reference**, the plan is to improve the process and revisit them all.

**Grape Geek** is a project dedicated to shining a light on hybrid grape varieties grown in the chilly climates of the northeast US and eastern Canada. These grapes often fly under the radar compared to their well-known vinifera cousins.

## What You'll Find Here

- **[Grape Varieties](varieties/index.md)** - Detailed articles about hybrid grape varieties with technical growing information
    - Coming soon (or not): Grower and winemaker stories in their own words, with full attribution
- **[About](about.md)** - Learn about the project philosophy and approach
- **[AI Usage](ai-usage.md)** - Transparency about how AI is used for research and content creation

## Latest Content

This site is a work in progress featuring initial research with citations and references. While I've put significant effort into attribution and sourcing real experiences from growers, winemakers, and researchers in cold-climate viticulture, this is still an imperfect first version that I hope to make more rigorous over time.
