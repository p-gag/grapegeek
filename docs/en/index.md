# Welcome to Grape Geek! 🍇

!!! info "🚧 Under Active Development 🚧"
    This site features a comprehensive grape variety database with VIVC integration and producer mapping across Quebec and northeastern US. New content and improvements are added regularly. La version française a besoin de plus d'amour. **Some content still lacks references** - the plan is to improve the process and revisit them all.

**Grape Geek** is a project dedicated to shining a light on hybrid grape varieties grown in the chilly climates of the northeast US and eastern Canada. These grapes often fly under the radar compared to their well-known vinifera cousins.

## Latest Content

This site is a work in progress featuring initial research with citations and references. While I've put significant effort into attribution and sourcing real experiences from growers, winemakers, and researchers in cold-climate viticulture, this is still an imperfect first version that I hope to make more rigorous over time.
