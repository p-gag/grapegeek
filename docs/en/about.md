# Grape Geek

Welcome to **Grape Geek**! 🍇

## About This Project

**Grape Geek** is my project dedicated to shining a light on hybrid grape varieties grown in the chilly climates of the northeast US and eastern Canada. These grapes often fly under the radar compared to their well-known vinifera cousins. My goal is to use AI tools and web searches to curate a treasure trove of **cited, field-tested, and winemaker-backed insights** into these unique varieties.

### How I Use AI

This site heavily uses AI for research and content generation, but with a focus on discovery rather than invention. I use AI tools to venture into the wild corners of the internet to find real testimonies and experiences from growers and winemakers.

For complete transparency about my AI usage, tools, and limitations, see the [AI Usage](/ai-usage/) page.

### My Personal Perspective and Biases

Beyond the obvious non-vinifera bias, I want to be transparent about my own leanings:

**Cold Climate Viticulture Focus:** I have a strong preference for grape varieties that thrive with minimal intervention in our harsh climate. This isn't a judgment on other approaches—I have huge respect for everyone growing grapes for a living with all the risks involved, whatever their methods. My focus on hardy varieties is grounded in a very long-term, multi-generational goal of finding wine grapes that can naturally resist local diseases, survive winters without protection, and flourish in our challenging conditions. I have the luxury of not doing this for money, which allows me to take this longer view.

**Quebec Bias (and Maritime Quebec Specifically):** I have a clear Quebec bias, and even more specifically toward maritime Quebec (yes, very niche), because, well, it's where I live. That said, I'm actively trying to include other regions in northern America because many did and still are making massive contributions. The grapes created by the great northern US hybridizers were and still are key to Quebec's success.

### What Grape Geek is About

* **Focus on Hybrids:** I'm all about hybrid grapes that thrive in colder regions. Unlike vinifera grapes (which have loads of existing info), hybrids are less documented and often full of surprises.
* **Casual Yet Transparent:** I blend careful sourcing and citations with a friendly, approachable tone. The idea is to make learning about these grapes enjoyable for everyone, from wine geeks to curious gardeners, while promoting the resources where I found the information.
* **Facts and Stories, No Forced Conclusions:** Some parts will be more fact-based (technical growing information, climate data), while others will focus on stories from growers and winemakers sharing their real experiences. Because the world of hybrid grapes is still evolving, I emphasize **showcasing different experiences and testimonials** rather than claiming definitive truths.
