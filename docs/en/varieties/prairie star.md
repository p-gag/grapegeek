## Overview
Ask growers from Vermont to Quebec about Prairie Star and you’ll hear a recurring theme: a hardy white that’s often “neutral” but surprisingly textural, used solo in some years and as a blender in others. Iowa State University’s variety sheet places Prairie Star among the Elmer Swenson selections, a white interspecific hybrid tested as E.S. 3-24-7, now found across cold zones from the Upper Midwest into the Northeast and eastern Canada. The sheet also notes its early season, “very hardy” credentials and that fruit often reaches 21–22 °Brix for winemaking. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university)) Vermont’s Northeastern Vine Supply describes it as widely planted for “lower acidity and neutral aromatics,” typically 20–22 °Brix, and valued to “lower the overall acidity and add body and finish” in blends. ([nevinesupply.com](https://www.nevinesupply.com/product/white-wine-prairie-star/15/?utm_source=openai)) Quebec nurseries (Vignes Chez Soi; Hardy Fruit Tree Nursery) sell it from Zone 4b up through colder pockets, underscoring demand on the Canadian side. ([vigneschezsoi.ca](https://vigneschezsoi.ca/en/product/prairie-star/?utm_source=openai))

## Origin & Breeding
Elmer Swenson made the cross in 1980 near Osceola, Wisconsin, selecting in 1984 and testing the seedling as E.S. 3-24-7. Parentage is E.S. 2‑7‑13 × E.S. 2‑8‑1. Tom Plocher and Bob Parke named it “Prairie Star” in 2000—an homage to Star Prairie, Wisconsin, where Swenson lived. Iowa State’s fact sheet documents that timeline and the naming, and the Grapebreeders index lists the same pedigree. Quebec’s Vignes Chez Soi repeats the cross and dates and adds that Plocher and Parke named Prairie Star alongside Louise Swenson because the two “go well together as blending partners.” ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university))

## Climate Adaptation & Hardiness
Iowa State summarizes Prairie Star as “very hardy (-20 °F to -35 °F),” and notes an eye-opening datapoint: the original seedling had more than 50% bud survival after a midwinter low of -40 °F. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university)) In practice, nurseries quote a range. Northeastern Vine Supply markets it “hardy to -38 °F,” while Hardy Fruit Tree Nursery in Quebec writes “as low as –38 °C.” St. Lawrence Nurseries goes further—“-50 °F with occasional injury”—illustrating how on-the-ground claims can drift with site and experience. ([nevinesupply.com](https://www.nevinesupply.com/product/white-wine-prairie-star/15/?utm_source=openai)) Frisky Fox (Iowa/Minnesota) plants it as a workhorse white for cold sites, and several Quebec retailers offer it for Zones 3–4b and warmer, suggesting comfort across USDA Zones 3–6 where snow cover and air drainage help. ([friskyfoxvineyard.com](https://www.friskyfoxvineyard.com/our-grapes?utm_source=openai))

## Phenology
Multiple sources put budbreak in the “mid-season” window. Iowa State adds the practical detail that Prairie Star ripens early: mid‑September around St. Paul, Minnesota, and mid‑ to late‑August in Iowa. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university)) Northeastern Vine Supply echoes “mid season bud break and early season ripening,” and Quebec’s Vignes Chez Soi estimates about 1,800 GDD (base 50 °F) to maturity, with mid‑September harvest in Zone 4b. ([nevinesupply.com](https://www.nevinesupply.com/product/white-wine-prairie-star/15/?utm_source=openai)) In the field, Acquaviva (Illinois) typically picks in the second week of September, while Lincoln Peak in Vermont co‑fermented a 2024 blend that included 23% Prairie Star from fruit picked between September 12 and 24—timing that tracks with “early” relative to many Northeast whites. ([acquavivawinery.com](https://acquavivawinery.com/product/prairie-star-2019/?utm_source=openai))

## Growth Habit
Paul Domoto (Iowa State) described Prairie Star as vigorous with a semi‑upright habit; cluster thinning “not necessary.” Iowa State’s sheet adds a cautionary note from Plocher and Parke: young shoots can snap in strong winds, so “high cordon training systems should be avoided.” They also mention rampant shoot growth during bloom that may reduce set; one technique they suggest is pinching shoot tips just prior to flowering. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university)) Yet practice varies. Frisky Fox says it’s “well adapted to a vertical shoot positioning system,” while Double A Vineyards ships it with Top Wire Cordon guidance and lists growth habit as semi‑upright—two different trellis philosophies showing up in commerce and cellar. ([friskyfoxvineyard.com](https://www.friskyfoxvineyard.com/our-grapes?utm_source=openai))

## Disease & Physiological Issues
Domoto reported moderate susceptibility to black rot and anthracnose, with slight susceptibility to downy and powdery mildew; he also noted moderate sensitivity to 2,4‑D and dicamba injury. The same sheet says sulfur sensitivity is unknown, while some growers reported using copper “without problems.” ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university)) Double A’s catalog mirrors much of that: black rot “moderately susceptible,” downy and powdery “slightly susceptible,” Botrytis “slightly susceptible.” ([doubleavineyards.com](https://doubleavineyards.com/products/prairie-star?utm_source=openai)) Hardy Fruit Tree Nursery repeats the “moderate” black rot/anthracnose line in its retail description, reinforcing the pattern. ([hardyfruittrees.ca](https://www.hardyfruittrees.ca/produit/all-trees/prairie-star-grape-vine/?utm_source=openai)) Several Midwestern and Quebec growers also mention variable fruit set—Domoto links poor set to rain during early bloom and to vigorous shoot growth at flowering, hence the tip‑pinching advice. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university))

## Fruit Composition & Sensory Profile
Iowa State’s sheet gives a working sugar target: “Sugar content typically runs 21° to 22° Brix.” In their narrative, Plocher and Parke characterize the wine as non‑foxy and “neutral” with uncommon fullness for a hybrid; in some years a “delicate floral nose” appears. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university)) Northeastern Vine Supply quantifies its role in blends—acidity “typically below 1%” with 20–22 °Brix—and calls it a tool for lowering acid and adding body. ([nevinesupply.com](https://www.nevinesupply.com/product/white-wine-prairie-star/15/?utm_source=openai)) On the sensory front, Acquaviva’s varietal bottling talks about a “semi‑dry, floral, exotic” profile with peaches, spices, grapefruit and some grassy tones, while Seven Hawks in Wisconsin leans into “tropical fruit” and a long, cinnamon‑spice finish. Grindstone Island in New York describes a semi‑sweet Prairie Star with “apricot, peach, and citrus.” ([acquavivawinery.com](https://acquavivawinery.com/product/prairie-star-2019/?utm_source=openai))

## Winemaking Approaches
In the Upper Midwest, Prairie Star often plays two roles. The first is blender: Frisky Fox and Northeastern Vine Supply both note it’s used to add mid‑palate and tame acid in drier whites. ([friskyfoxvineyard.com](https://www.friskyfoxvineyard.com/our-grapes?utm_source=openai)) The second is a varietal or near‑varietal, handled gently. Acquaviva ferments cold in stainless to preserve aromatic lift, landing in a semi‑dry style; Grindstone Island follows similar cool stainless ferments for a semi‑sweet expression. Northeastern Vine Supply even mentions barrel‑fermented versions—often with a touch of a more aromatic variety—seeking a textural style some compare to California Chardonnay. ([acquavivawinery.com](https://acquavivawinery.com/product/prairie-star-2019/?utm_source=openai)) In Vermont, Lincoln Peak used Prairie Star as 23% of a co‑fermented stainless blend with Louise Swenson (and a small La Crescent component), producing a “citrusy, fresh, chalky” profile—a regional snapshot of how it can lend body without overwhelming the nose.

## Example Styles & Uses
- Solo, semi‑dry Midwest white: Acquaviva’s Prairie Star (first bottled 2011; regularly harvested around the second week of September) has won medals from the Finger Lakes and Illinois competitions, showing one path for a stand‑alone style. ([acquavivawinery.com](https://acquavivawinery.com/product/prairie-star-2019/?utm_source=openai))  
- Semi‑sweet Thousand Islands NY: Grindstone Island’s Prairie Star channels stone fruit and citrus via cool stainless ferments. ([newyork.guides.winefolly.com](https://newyork.guides.winefolly.com/wineries/grindstone-island-winery/wines/prairie-star/?utm_source=openai))  
- Wisconsin varietal: Seven Hawks bottles a Prairie Star that they compare favorably to Riesling or Sauvignon Blanc in weight and finish. ([sevenhawksvineyards.com](https://www.sevenhawksvineyards.com/product/prairie-star/?utm_source=openai))  
- New England blends: Lincoln Peak’s “Limestone” (VT) co‑ferments Louise Swenson and Prairie Star for a dry, mineral white, while Montview (VT) has blended Prairie Star with Frontenac Gris. ([lincolnpeakvineyard.com](https://www.lincolnpeakvineyard.com/our-wines?utm_source=openai))  
- Table/juice crossover: Quebec nurseries consistently market Prairie Star as a seeded green table grape with “honey” or “apple” notes and good juice quality—reminders of its versatility outside the winery.

## Open Questions & Conflicting Reports
- How hardy is “hardy”? Iowa State documents “very hardy (-20 to -35 °F)” with a single seedling surviving -40 °F; nurseries quote everything from -32 °C to “possibly -40 °F,” and one even lists “-50 °F with occasional injury.” These ranges likely reflect site and snow cover as much as genetics. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university))  
- What trellis fits best? Iowa State cautions against high cordons due to shoot brittleness in wind and points toward VSP; a Minnesota/Iowa processor agrees VSP is a good fit. Yet one major nursery suggests Top Wire Cordon and provides HW‑style guidance. Growers seem to succeed both ways—and tell different stories about labor and breakage. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university))  
- How “neutral” is it really? Plocher and Parke’s “neutral with fullness” description sits alongside reported floral seasons, and wineries in NY/IL/WI talk about citrus, peach and spice. That spectrum—neutral blender to aromatic soloist—may hinge on season, site and cellar choices (cool stainless vs barrel). ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university))  
- Set problems and fixes: Poor fruit set during rainy bloom and during rampant vegetative growth is repeatedly noted; pinching apical tips pre‑bloom is suggested. Some growers still report partial clusters and “shot berries” in certain years, and the underlying causes remain a local puzzle. ([yumpu.com](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/3793620/prairie-star-viticulture-iowa-state-university))  
- Acid and GDD targets: Quebec guidance pegs maturity near ~1,800 GDD (base 50 °F) and “mid‑September” in Zone 4b, while Iowa/Minnesota harvest windows vary from late August to mid‑September. Whether Prairie Star always comes in “early” relative to Frontenac‑family whites is still a vineyard‑by‑vineyard story.
