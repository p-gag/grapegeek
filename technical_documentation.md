# Technical Documentation: Grape Geek Page Generation

## General Prompting Style

**Overall Tone & Guidelines:**

* Use a consistent, casual tone that makes the content friendly for a general audience.
* Maintain academic rigor by including citations from specific, named entities: researchers, growers, winemakers, etc.
* Avoid drawing firm conclusions. Instead, present a variety of perspectives and let the reader appreciate the diversity of opinion.

## Section-Specific Prompts

For each section of a grape variety page, I'll have a dedicated prompt. For example:

* **Overview Section Prompt:** "Summarize this grape's origin, parentage, and main growing regions. Include a quote from a breeder or researcher about its development history."
* **Climate Adaptation Section Prompt:** "Describe the grape's cold hardiness using climate zone references. Include a grower's experience with frost or a magazine's note on its typical winter survival."
* **Disease & Physiological Issues Prompt:** "List common disease pressures and include quotes from winemakers about their vineyard management practices."

## Full Page Generation Process

1. **Load the General Prompt:** This sets the tone and the style for the entire page.
2. **Loop Through Sections:** For each section (Overview, Climate Adaptation, Disease Issues, etc.), load the section-specific prompt and any specific page details (like the grape variety's name).
3. **AI + Web Search Mix:** Each section is generated by combining AI-driven text creation with targeted web search results to pull in real citations.
4. **Concatenate Sections:** At the end, I'll merge all sections into a single page. I can start with a simple script to do this concatenation, and later I might let the AI refine the final flow if needed.
