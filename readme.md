# Grape Geek

Welcome to **Grape Geek**! 🍇

## About This Project

**Grape Geek** is a project dedicated to shining a light on hybrid grape varieties grown in the chilly climates of the northeast US and eastern Canada. These grapes often fly under the radar compared to their well-known vinifera cousins. Our goal is to use AI tools and web searches to curate a treasure trove of **cited, field-tested, and winemaker-backed insights** into these unique varieties.

### What Grape Geek is About

* **Focus on Hybrids:** We’re all about hybrid grapes that thrive in colder regions. Unlike vinifera grapes (which have loads of existing info), hybrids are less documented and often full of surprises.
* **Casual Yet Rigorous:** We blend the rigor of academic citation with a friendly, approachable tone. The idea is to make learning about these grapes enjoyable for everyone, from wine geeks to curious gardeners.
* **No Forced Conclusions:** Because the world of hybrid grapes is still evolving, we emphasize **showcasing different experiences and testimonials** rather than claiming definitive truths.

### Why Only Hybrids in the Northeast?

We’re focusing on the northeastern US and eastern Canada because these regions are true testing grounds for cold-hardy hybrids. This is where you’ll find unique varieties that aren't household names—yet! And it’s precisely because they’re less documented that we think they deserve a spotlight.

Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. So we’ll treat these "entities"—like researchers, growers, winemakers, breeders, magazines—as a kind of special highlight. That way, each page isn't just a dry list of facts; it's sprinkled with personal, relatable quotes and sources from these individuals and groups.

So, here's how we can lay out the technical documentation for generating each page:

## Technical Documentation: Grape Geek Page Generation

### General Prompting Style

**Overall Tone & Guidelines:**

* Use a consistent, casual tone that makes the content friendly for a general audience.
* Maintain academic rigor by including citations from specific, named entities: researchers, growers, winemakers, etc.
* Avoid drawing firm conclusions. Instead, present a variety of perspectives and let the reader appreciate the diversity of opinion.

### Section-Specific Prompts

For each section of a grape variety page, we’ll have a dedicated prompt. For example:

* **Overview Section Prompt:** "Summarize this grape's origin, parentage, and main growing regions. Include a quote from a breeder or researcher about its development history."
* **Climate Adaptation Section Prompt:** "Describe the grape’s cold hardiness using climate zone references. Include a grower’s experience with frost or a magazine’s note on its typical winter survival."
* **Disease & Physiological Issues Prompt:** "List common disease pressures and include quotes from winemakers about their vineyard management practices."

### Full Page Generation Process

1. **Load the General Prompt:** This sets the tone and the style for the entire page.
2. **Loop Through Sections:** For each section (Overview, Climate Adaptation, Disease Issues, etc.), load the section-specific prompt and any specific page details (like the grape variety’s name).
3. **AI + Web Search Mix:** Each section is generated by combining AI-driven text creation with targeted web search results to pull in real citations.
4. **Concatenate Sections:** At the end, we’ll merge all sections into a single page. We can start with a simple script to do this concatenation, and later we might let the AI refine the final flow if needed.
